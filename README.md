# Discord Bot List and Server List Problems

Thank you for informing us of any problems you are experiencing. You are assisting us and the community in making the Discord Bot List (and the server list) a better place for everyone by doing so.

Please follow these simple rules before reporting an issue:

- Your report should be brief and to the point.
- Keep discussions focused on the topic at hand, and be friendly and constructive.

Choose the template that best describes your problem/report:

1. [Report a Bug/Issue]
(https://github.com/astra-bots/issues/issues/new)

## Rating a Report or a Comment

We appreciate the community's collaboration and any feedback you provide, whether it's as simple as an upvote or downvote on issues and comments.
If you want to give feedback, use :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: and/or comment with your thoughts/suggestions on the issue.

## Report Deliberation

When discussing/commenting on reports, we expect respectful discussions and constructive feedback/criticism. Please keep your discussions on topic and to the point to avoid unnecessary conversations that may lead to arguments.
We encourage all members of both communities to share their thoughts and ideas. This gives us a better understanding of what is most important to you and the best solutions to problems.

When it comes to discussing issues, both our rules and Discord's Terms of Service apply.
